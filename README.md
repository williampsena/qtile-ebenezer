## Installation

### For Arch users

I developed an AUR package to install this package. I have no experience with AUR packages, so if you discover anything wrong, please contact me at issues.

#### Option 1: Using yay

```shell
yay -Syu python-qtile-ebenezer
```

#### Option 2: Using pamac (Manjaro)

```shell
pamac update
pamac install python-qtile-ebenezer
```

### PIP

You can install directly as a typical method using pip.

> However, this is not the greatest method because you risk breaking the OS by installing packages worldwide using Pip.

```shell
pip install qtile-ebenezer
```

### Using

Some tests to run at repl 'python':

```python
from ebenezer.core.files import resolve_file_path
resolve_file_path("$home")
# '/home/your_home'
```


# The Ebenezer CLI

A CLI tool for backlight, wallpaper, volume control and other helpers.

## Usage

```shell
ebenezer backlight --help
ebenezer volume --help
ebenezer wallpaper --help
```
